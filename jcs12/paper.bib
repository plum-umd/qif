              extends our previously proposed DBM-based numerical
              abstract domain and allows us to represent invariants of
              the form ($\pm x \pm y \leq c$), where $x$ and $y$ are
              program variables and $c$ is a real constant. We focus
              on giving an efficient representation based on
              Difference-Bound Matrices---$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory
              cost, where $n$ is the number of variables---and
              graph-based algorithms for all common abstract
              operators---$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time cost. This includes
              a normal form algorithm to test equivalence of
              representation and a widening operator to compute least
              fixpoint approximations."
