\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The next section presents a technical overview of the paper through a
running example.  Full details of the approach are presented in
Sections~\ref{sec:belief}--\ref{sec:impl}. 

\myparagraph{Knowledge-based policies and beliefs}  User Bob would
like to enforce a knowledge-based policy on his data so that
advertisers do not learn too much about him.  Suppose Bob considers
his birthday of September 27, 1980 to be relatively private; variable
$\var{bday}$ stores the calendar day (a number between 0 and 364,
which for Bob would be 270) and
$\var{byear}$ stores the birth year (which would be 1980).  To
$\var{bday}$ he assigns a \emph{knowledge threshold} $t_{\var{d}} =
0.2$ stating that he does not want an advertiser to have better than a
20\% likelihood of guessing his birth day.  To the pair
$(\var{bday},\var{byear})$ he assigns a threshold $t_{\var{dy}} =
0.05$, meaning he does not want an advertiser to be able to guess the
combination of birth day \emph{and} year together with better than a
5\% likelihood.

Bob runs an agent program to answer queries about his data on his
behalf.  This agent models an estimated \emph{belief} of queriers as a
probability distribution $\delta$, which is conceptually a map from
secret states to positive real numbers representing probabilities (in
range $[0,1]$).  Bob's secret state is the pair $(\var{bday}\! =\!
270,\var{byear}\! =\! 1980)$.  The agent represents a distribution as a
set of probabilistic polyhedra.  For now, we can think of a
probabilistic polyhedron as a standard convex polyhedron $\getpoly{}$
with a probability mass $m$, where the probability of each integer
point contained in $\getpoly{}$ is $m / \psize{\getpoly{}}$, where
$\psize{\getpoly{}}$ is the number of integer points contained in the
polyhedron $\getpoly{}$.  Shortly we present a more involved
representation.

Initially, the agent might model an advertiser $X$'s belief using the
following rectangular polyhedron $\getpoly{}$, where each point
contained in it is considered equally likely ($m = 1$):
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\getpoly{} = 0 \leq \var{bday} < 365,\; 1956 \leq \var{byear} < 1993
\end{array}
$$
An initial belief such as this one could be derived from several
sources.  For example, Facebook publishes demographics of its
users~\cite{facebook-demographics}, and similar sorts of personal
demographics could be drawn from census data, surveys, employee
records, etc.  Demographics are also relevant to other applications;
e.g., initial beliefs for hiding web browser footprints can be based
on browser surveys, likely movie preferences can be found from IMDB,
and so on.  In general, we observe that understanding the capabilities
and knowledge of a potential adversary is necessary no matter the kind
of security policy used; often this determination is implicit, rather
than explicit as in our approach.  We defer further discussion on this
topic to Sections~\ref{sec:related} and~\ref{sec:future-work}. 

\myparagraph{Enforcing knowledge-based policies safely} Suppose $X$
wants to identify users whose birthday falls within the next week, to
promote a special offer.  $X$ sends Bob's agent the following program.
\begin{example} 
\label{ex:bday}
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{l}
\sassign{\var{today}}{260}; \\
\sifk\; {\var{bday} \geq today \wedge \var{bday} < (today+7)}\;\sthenk \\
\quad \sassign{\var{output}}{\strue};\\
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
This program refers to Bob's secret variable $\var{bday}$, and also
uses non-secret variables $\var{today}$, which represents the current
day and is here set to be 260, and $\var{output}$, which is set to
$\strue$ if the user's birthday is within the next seven days (we
assume $\var{output}$ is initially $\sfalse$).
\end{example}

The agent must decide whether returning the result of running this
program will potentially increase $X$'s knowledge about Bob's data
above the prescribed threshold.  We explain how it makes this
determination shortly, but for the present we can see that answering
the query is safe: the returned $\var{output}$ variable will be
$\sfalse$ which essentially teaches the querier that Bob's birthday is
not within the next week, which still leaves many possibilities.  As
such, the agent \emph{revises} his model of the querier's belief to be
the following \emph{pair} of rectangular polyhedra $\getpoly{1},
\getpoly{2}$, where again all points in each are equally likely (with
probability masses $m_1 = \frac{260}{358} \approx 0.726, m_2 =
\frac{98}{358} \approx 0.274$):
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\getpoly{1} = 0 \leq \var{bday} < 260,\; 1956 \leq \var{byear} < 1993 \quad \\
\getpoly{2} = 267 \leq \var{bday} < 365,\; 1956 \leq \var{byear} <  1993 \quad \\
\end{array}
$$ Ignoring $\var{byear}$, there are 358 possible values for
$\var{bday}$ and each is equally likely. Thus the probability of any
one is $1 / 358 \approx 0.0028 \leq t_{\var{d}} = 0.2$. More
explicitly, the same quantity can be computed using the definition of
conditional probability: $ Pr(A | B) = Pr(A \wedge B) / Pr(B) $ where
event $ A $ refers to $\var{bday} $ having one particular value (e.g.,
\emph{not
in the next week}) and event $ B $ refers to the query returning $
\sfalse $. Thus $ 1 / 358 = \frac{1}{365} / \frac{358}{365}
$.

Suppose the next day the same advertiser sends the same program to
Bob's user agent, but with $\var{today}$ set to 261.  Should the agent
run the program?  At first glance, doing so seems OK.  The program
will return $\sfalse$, and the revised belief will be the same as
above but with constraint $\var{bday} \geq 267$ changed to $\var{bday}
\geq 268$, meaning there is still only a $1 / 357 \approx 0.0028$
chance to guess $\var{bday}$.

But suppose Bob's birth day was actually 267, rather than 270.  The
first query would have produced the same revised belief as before, but
since the second query would return $\strue$ (since $\var{bday}=267 <
(261 + 7)$), the querier can deduce Bob's birth day exactly:
$\var{bday} \geq 267$ (from the first query) and $\var{bday} < 268$
(from the second query) together imply that $\var{bday} = 267$!  But
the user agent is now stuck: it cannot simply refuse to answer the
query, because the querier knows that with $t_{\var{d}} = 0.2$ (or
indeed, any reasonable threshold) the only good reason to refuse is
when $\var{bday} = 267$.  As such, refusal essentially tells the
querier the answer.

The lesson is that the decision to refuse a query must not be based on
the effect of running the query on the actual secret, because then a
refusal could leak information.  In Section~\ref{sec:policy} we
propose that an agent should reject a program if there exists
\emph{any} possible secret that could cause a program answer to
increase querier knowledge above the threshold. As such we would
reject the second query regardless of whether $\var{bday} = 270$ or
$\var{bday} = 267$. This makes the policy decision
\emph{simulatable}~\cite{kenthapadi05simulatable}: given knowledge of
the current belief model and the belief-tracking implementation being
used, the querier can determine whether his query will be rejected on
his own.

\myparagraph{Full probabilistic polyhedra} Now suppose, having run the first
query and rejected the second, the user agent receives the following
program from $X$.
\begin{example}
\label{ex:specyear}
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{l}
\sassign{\var{age}}{2011 - \var{byear}}; \\
\sifk\; {\var{age} = 20 \vee \var{age} = 30 \vee ... \vee \var{age} = 60}\;\sthenk\;
\sassign{\var{output}}{\strue};\\
\spifnoelse{0.1}{\sassign{\var{output}}{\strue}};
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
This program attempts to discover whether this year is a ``special''
year for the given user, who thus deserves a special offer.  The
program returns $\strue$ if either the user's age is (or will be) an
exact decade, or if the user wins the luck of the draw (one chance in
ten), as implemented by the probabilistic if statement.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/bands1.pdf} &
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/bands2.pdf} \\
(a) $\var{output} = \sfalse$ & 
(b) $\var{output} = \strue$ \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example 2: most precise revised beliefs}
\label{fig:bands}
\end{figure}

Running this program reveals nothing about $\var{bday}$, but does
reveal something about $\var{byear}$.  In particular, if $\var{output}
= \sfalse$ then the querier knows that $\var{byear} \not\in \{ 1991,$
$1981,$ $1971,$ $1961 \}$, but all other years are equally likely.  We
could represent this new knowledge, combined with the knowledge gained
from the first query, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bands}(a), where
each shaded box is a polyhedron containing equally likely points.  On
the other hand, if $\var{output} = \strue$ then either $\var{byear}
\in \{ 1991, 1981, 1971, 1961 \}$ or the user got lucky.  We represent
the querier's knowledge in this case as in Figure~\ref{fig:bands}(b).
Darker shading indicates higher probability; thus, all years are still
possible, though some are much more likely than others.  With the
given threshold of $t_{\var{dy}} = 0.05$, the agent will permit the
query; when $\var{output} = \sfalse$, the likelihood of any point in
the shaded region is
$\paren{\frac{9}{10}*\frac{1}{37*358}}/\paren{\frac{9}{10}*\frac{33}{37}}=1/(33
* 358) $; when $\var{output} = \strue$, the points in the dark bands
are the most likely, with probability $
\paren{\frac{1}{37*358}}/\paren{\frac{9}{10}*\frac{4}{37} +
  \frac{1}{10}} = 10 / (73 * 358) $ (this and the previous calculation
are also just instantiations of the definition of conditional
probability). Since both outcomes are possible with Bob's $\var{byear}
= 1980$, the revised belief will depend on the result of the
probabilistic if statement.

This example illustrates a potential problem with the simple
representation of probabilistic polyhedra mentioned earlier: when
$\var{output} = \sfalse$ we will jump from using two probabilistic
polyhedra to ten, and when $\var{output} = \strue$ we jump to using
eighteen.  Allowing the number of polyhedra to grow without bound will
result in performance problems.  To address this concern, we need a way
to abstract our belief representation to be more concise.

Section~\ref{sec:absinterp} shows how to represent a probabilistic
polyhedron $\pp{}$ as a seven-tuple, $(\getpoly{},\smin{}, \smax{},
\pmin{}, \pmax{}, \mmin{}, \mmax{})$ where $\smin{}$ and $ \smax{}$
are lower and upper bounds on the number of points with non-zero
probability in the polyhedron $\getpoly{}$ (called the \textit{support
  points} of $C$); the quantities $\pmin{} $ and $ \pmax{} $ are lower
and upper bounds on the probability mass per support point; and $
\mmin{} $ and $ \mmax{} $ give bounds on the total probability
mass. Thus, polyhedra modeled using the simpler representation
$(\getpoly{},m)$ given earlier are equivalent to ones in the more
involved representation with $\mmax{} = \mmin{} = m$, $\pmax{} =
\pmin{} = m / \psize{\getpoly{}}$, and $\smax{} = \smin{} =
\psize{\getpoly{}}$.

% ref{fig:bands}(a) would include only
%the $ \paren{\frac{9}{10}*\frac{1}{37*358}} $ component.

With the seven-tuple representation, we could choose to collapse the
sets of polyhedra given in Figure~\ref{fig:bands}.  For example, we
could represent Figure~\ref{fig:bands}(a) with two probabilistic
polyhedra $\pp{1}$ and $\pp{2}$ containing polyhedra $\getpoly{1}$ and
$\getpoly{2}$ defined above, respectively, essentially drawing a box
around the two groupings of smaller boxes in the figure.  The other
parameters for $\pp{1}$ would be as follows (explained below):
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\pmin{1} = \pmax{1} = 9/135050 = \frac{1}{37*365}*\frac{9}{10} \\
\smin{1} = \smax{1} = 8580 = 260 * 33 \\
\mmin{1} = \mmax{1} = 7722/13505 = \pmin{1} * \smin{1} \\
\end{array}
$$ Notice that $\smin{1} = \smax{1} = 8580 < \psize{\getpoly{1}} =
9620$, illustrating that the ``bounding box'' of the polyhedron covers
more area than is strictly necessary. The other thing to notice is
that the probabilities and probability mass are not normalized; we do
this for efficiency and precision considerations made clear in
Section~\ref{sec:absinterp}. Non-normalized probabilities arise during
conditioning---instead of performing $ Pr(A | B) = Pr(A \wedge B) /
Pr(B) $ we instead only perform the $ Pr(A \wedge B) $ component and
delay normalization until making a security decision.  In this
representation, after \eref{ex:bday} returns $
\sfalse $ the probability of each $
\var{bday} , \var{byear} $ combination in the polyhedron would be stored as $
\frac{1}{37*365} $ instead of the full conditional probability $
\frac{1}{37*365}/\frac{358}{365} $.  After the next query, \eref{ex:specyear}, returns $ \sfalse $, we
would store $ \frac{1}{37*365} * \frac{9}{10} $, which is given
above.  This probability corresponds to
the probability $ Pr(A \wedge B \wedge C) $, where $ A $ is the event
of having a particular non-special $\var{bday},\var{byear}$ not within
the next week, $ B $ corresponds to the event that the first query
returns $ \sfalse $ and $ C $ corresponds to the event that the second
query returns $ \sfalse $. To compute 
probabilities $ Pr(A | B \wedge C)$, we normalize by dividing 
$ Pr(A \wedge B \wedge C) $ by $ Pr(B \wedge C) $, which we can
conveniently recover from the total mass components of the
probabilistic polyhedron.

% Since our representation is not
% normalized, we would see that $ \mmax{1} + \mmax{2} \not= 1 $.

%$\pp{2}$ happens to have $\mmin{2} =
%\mmax{2} = 14553 / 67525 $ with $\mmax{1} + \mmax{2} = (53163 / 67525)
%\not= 1$.

Now if we consider the representation of Figure~\ref{fig:bands}(b) in a
similar manner, using the same two polyhedra $\getpoly{1}$ and
$\getpoly{2}$, the other parameters for $\getpoly{1}$ are as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-nonuniform}
\begin{array}{ll}
\pmin{1} = 1/135050 = \frac{1}{37*365}*\frac{1}{10} & \pmax{1} =
10/135050 = \frac{1}{37*365} \\
\smin{1} = 9620 = 260 * 37 & \smax{1} = 9620 =260 * 37 \\
\mmin{1} = 26/185 & \mmax{1} = 26/185 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
In this case $\smin{1} = \smax{1} = \psize{\getpoly{1}}$, meaning
that all covered points are possible, but $\pmin{1} \not= \pmax{1}$ as
some points are more probable than others (i.e., those in the darker
band). An astute reader might notice that here $ \mmin{1} \neq
\pmin{1} * \smin{1} $ and $ \mmax{1} \neq \pmax{1} * \smax{1} $. The
benefit of these seemingly redundant total mass quantities in the
representation is that they can sometimes be computed precisely. In
this case $ \mmin{1} = \mmax{1} = \frac{4}{37}*\frac{260}{365} +
\frac{1}{10}*\frac{33}{37}*\frac{260}{365} $. This quantity is the
probability of the query returning $ \strue $ while having a special
year (first term) plus not having a special year (second
term).

The key property of probabilistic polyhedra, and a main technical
contribution of this paper, is that this abstraction can be used to make
sound security policy decisions.  To accept a query, we must check that, for
all possible outputs, the querier's revised, normalized belief of any of the
possible secrets is below the threshold $t$.  In checking whether the
revised beliefs in our example are acceptable, the agent will try to find
the maximum probability the querier could ascribe to a state, for each
possible output.  In the case $\var{output} = \strue$, the most probable
points are those in the dark bands, which each have probability mass
$10/135050 = \pmax{1}$ (the dark bands in $\pp{2}$ have the same
probability).
% But it is not enough to know
% this value.  We need to know how it compares to the probabilities of
% the other points.  That is, we have to \textit{normalize} the
% distribution before we can find the maximum probability of any point.
To find the maximum conditional, or \emph{normalized}, probability of
these points, we divide by the minimum possible total mass, as given
by the lower bounds in our abstraction.  In our example, this results
in $\pmax{1} / (\mmin{1} + \mmin{2})$ $=$ $\frac{10}{135050} / \paren{\frac{26}{185} +
\frac{49}{925}} \approx 0.0004 \leq t_{\var{d}} = 0.05$.

As just shown, the bound on minimum total mass is needed in order to soundly
normalize distributions in our abstraction.  The maintenance of such lower
bounds on probability mass is a key component of our abstraction that is
missing from prior work.  Each of the components of a probabilistic
polyhedron play a role in producing the lower bound on total mass.  While
$\smin{1}, \smax{1}, \pmin{1},$ and $\mmax{1}$ do not play a role in making
the final policy decision, their existence allows us to more accurately
update belief during the query evaluation that precedes the final policy
check.  The choice of the number of probabilistic polyhedra to
use impacts both precision and performance, so choosing the right number is
a challenge.  

Another precision/performance tradeoff coincides with the choice of
the \emph{kind} of polyhedron used to represent constraints.  If we
restrict constraints to always form \emph{intervals}
\cite{cousot76static} (a.k.a. boxes) or \emph{octagons}
\cite{mine01octagon} we can speed up performance by simplifying some
of the abstract operations (e.g., counting points), but at the
possible cost of precision, since some polyhedral shapes are now
approximated.  For the queries given in this section, using
probabilistic polyhedra produces answers in a few seconds, while using
probabilistic intervals produces answers in a few milliseconds, with
no loss of precision. Details are given in
Section~\ref{sec:impl}. Probabilistic intervals are not ideal for
every query; in Section~\ref{sec:relational} we describe queries for
which the probabilistic octagons or polyhedra domains are
necessary. \pxm{Added last 2 sentences.}
