**FCS 2014 Implementation and Experiments**

### Installation

There are two options for running the experiments.

 1. On your own computer. This requires to install various
    prerequisites and has only been tested on Debian Linux, FreeBSD,
    and Mac OSX. See README.txt inside
    [experiments.tar.gz](experiments.tar.gz) for
    further instruction.

 2. Inside a VirtualBox image, located at:

    http://www.cs.umd.edu/~piotrm/virtualboxes/debian_oakland14_fcs14.tar.gz

    Everything has been already set up in this image. Login as
    *user*/*user* and look in the *~/fcs14* folder for more
    information. The root password is *toor* if you need it. The
    optional gnuplot package for generating the graphs in the paper is
    not installed to keep the image smaller. You can easily install
    it:

    > sudo apt-get install gnuplot
