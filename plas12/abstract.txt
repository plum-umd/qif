Title: Knowledge-oriented Secure Multiparty Computation
Authors: Stephen Magill, Piotr Mardziel, Michael Hicks, Jon Katz

Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a scheme that allows two or
more principals to compute a function over secret values without
having to reveal those values, e.g., to a third party.  While these
secret values are not directly revealed, each party learns something
about the secrets based on the public result.  There is a risk that
such a result will reveal too much over time, particularly if
principals participate un many SMCs.  To reduce the risk of unintended
information release, we sketch a method to track the information that
is implied about the secret inputs from the output of an SMC, and how
to safely avoid paricipating in SMCs that would reveal too much
information to the other participants.  We expect that our approach
can be used to expand the scenarios in which SMC could be used
fruitfully.
