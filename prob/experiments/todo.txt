0. delete tasks.storable, tasks_add.storable, tasks/*
1. edit create_benches_anilesh.sh to generate tests
1.b. perl create_tasks.pl ../examples/bench/bday.pol 0 9 1 1 box halfs
ARGS: 1 (bday.pol): policy file to run
      2 (0): starting precision
      3 (9): ending precision
      4 (1): precision increment
      5 (1): number of repeated runs, best for random tests
      6 (box): domain
      7 (halfs): simplifyer strategy
2. run the above script
3. perl run_tasks.pl <NUM OF CORES>
4. perl gen_report ../examples/benches/bday.pol 2 0 
   the first number is query number 
   second number is policy number, but leave as 0 
5. this will generate:
   a. data_stats.tsv which you can combine to form graphs
   b. stats_graph2.eps generated from plot.gnu (gnuplot)
   c. plot.gnu gnuplot file that generates graph from datafile
