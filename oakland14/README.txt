There are two options for running the experiments.

1. On your own computer. This requires to install various
prerequisites and has only been tested on Debian Linux, FreeBSD, and
Mac OSX. See experiments.tar.gz for further instruction.

2. Inside a VirtualBox image, located at:

  http://www.cs.umd.edu/~piotrm/oakland14/debian.tar.gz

Everything has been already set up in this image. Login as
user/user and look in the ~/oakland14 folder for more
information. The root password is toor if you need it. The optional
gnuplot package for generating the graphs in the paper is not
installed to keep the image smaller. You can easily install it:

  > sudo apt-get install gnuplot
