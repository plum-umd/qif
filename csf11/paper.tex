% Following Simon PJ (Kent Beck, actually) abstract structure:
% 1. State the problem 
% 2. Say why itâ€™s an interesting problem 
% 3. Say what your solution achieves 
% 4. Say what follows from your solution
  This paper explores the idea of \emph{knowledge-based security
    policies}, which are used to decide whether to answer queries over
  secret data based on an estimation of the querier's (possibly
  increased) knowledge given the results.  Limiting knowledge is the
  goal of existing information release policies that employ mechanisms
  such as noising, anonymization, and redaction.  Knowledge-based
  policies are more general: they increase flexibility by not fixing
  the means to restrict information flow.  We enforce a
  knowledge-based policy by explicitly tracking a model of a querier's
  belief about secret data, represented as a probability distribution,
  and denying any query that could increase knowledge above a given
  threshold.  We implement query analysis and belief tracking via
  abstract interpretation using a novel 
  \emph{probabilistic polyhedral} domain, whose design permits trading off
  precision with performance while ensuring estimates of a querier's
  knowledge are sound.  Experiments with our implementation show that
  several useful queries can be handled efficiently, and performance
  scales far better than would more standard implementations of
  probabilistic computation based on sampling.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper has explored the idea of \emph{knowledge-based security
  policies}: given a query over some secret data, that query should
only be answered if doing so will not increase the querier's knowledge
above a fixed threshold.  We enforce knowledge-based policies by
explicitly tracking a model of a querier's belief about secret data,
represented as a probability distribution, and we deny any query that
could increase knowledge above the threshold.  Our denial criterion
is independent of the actual secret, so denial does not leak
information.  We implement query analysis and belief tracking via
abstract interpretation using

\emph{probabilistic polyhedral} domains.

novel domains of \emph{probabilistic
  polyhedra} and \emph{powersets of probabilistic polyhedra}.
\fi
Compared to typical approaches to implementing belief revision, our
implementation using this domain is more efficient and scales better.
